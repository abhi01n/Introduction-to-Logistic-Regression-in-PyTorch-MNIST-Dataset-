# Introduction-to-Logistic-Regression-in-PyTorch-MNIST-Dataset-
In this notebook, i am going to build a very simple neural network in PyTorch to do handwritten digit classification. First, i'll start with some exploration of the MNIST dataset, explaining how we load and format the data. We'll then jump into motivating and then implementing the logistic regression model, including the forward and backwards pass, loss functions, and optimizers. After training the model, we'll evaluate how we did and visualize what we've learned. Finally, we'll refactor our code in an object-oriented manner, using higher level APIs.
